you can call any microservices through eureka which is registered with api gateway,
 so if you want to implement them on API gateway
and you can only allow those things which are authenticated in your microservices.

custom routes:to redirect request using custom url from gateway to the naming server and also
having the load balancer https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-with-spring-boot-and-spring-cloud/learn/lecture/24346944#overview
